## Problem Statement

The need of a trader who wishes to embrace new technologies in order to update their business and innovate is primarily driven by the desire to boost sales by establishing an online presence. This is particularly important as the merchant/florist wants to showcase their work, which primarily involves selling pots of various sizes and models.

Justification
Considering the solution to the problem addressed in this project, it is of great importance. Nowadays, a business cannot be considered competitive without a presence in the online sales market. Online sales have been growing rapidly day by day and are gradually replacing traditional in-person sales. This makes it imperative for any company, offering goods and/or services, to have a website to increase their visibility and enhance their sales since the online reach is significantly broader.
