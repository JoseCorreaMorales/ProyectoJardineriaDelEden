                <h1>The flowerpot, an important choice</h1>
        
                    <p>By José Manuel Olivian in <a href="https://medium.com/@Plantadecor/la-maceta-una-elecci%C3%B3n-importante-bff6f0dd475f" target="_blank">Medium</a></p><br>


                    <p> With certain frequency, the most attention to our care or choices is taken by the plants, a quite logical question, but it is not the only thing we should focus on. One of the items that is more important than what is often borrowed is the flowerpot. Although it is often considered a plant beautifier or simply a container, we have to take into account the types and characteristics they have to select the one that best suits our species and the circumstances where it will be. </p>

                        <p> <b> To make the right decision </b>, several aspects must be taken into account: </p> <br>
        
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                               
                                <p> <b> Where are you going to place it? </b> It is not the same outside as inside the home or premises. In this sense, those that are located outdoors must have a good drainage system to prevent the roots from rotting if it rains a lot or there is an excess of watering. It will also have to withstand extreme hot and cold temperatures. </p>
                            </li>

Each one has its properties, which we will explain in a future post, and depending on The use that is going to be given to it and the place where it is put, one material or another will be more convenient. </p>
                            </li>

                            <p> <b> Is it for a plant that requires a special pot? </b> In this case the pot will be determined by said plant, in this typology there would be for example some orchids, bonsai, fruit trees ... </p>
